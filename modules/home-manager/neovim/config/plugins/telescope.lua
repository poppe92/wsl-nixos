    -- Telescope is a fuzzy finder that comes with a lot of different things that
    -- it can fuzzy find! It's more than just a "file finder", it can search
    -- many different aspects of Neovim, your workspace, LSP, and more!
    --
    -- The easiest way to use Telescope, is to start by doing something like:
    --  :Telescope help_tags
    --
    -- After running this command, a window will open up and you're able to
    -- type in the prompt window. You'll see a list of `help_tags` options and
    -- a corresponding preview of the help.
    --
    -- Two important keymaps to use while in Telescope are:
    --  - Insert mode: <c-/>
    --  - Normal mode: ?
    --
    -- This opens a window that shows you all of the keymaps for the current
    -- Telescope picker. This is really useful to discover what Telescope can
    -- do as well as how to actually do it!

    -- [[ Configure Telescope ]]
    -- See `:help telescope` and `:help telescope.setup()`
    require('telescope').setup {
      -- You can put your default mappings / updates / etc. in here
      --  All the info you're looking for is in `:help telescope.setup()`

      --   mappings = {
      --     i = { ['<c-enter>'] = 'to_fuzzy_refine' },
